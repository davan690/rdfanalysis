## Introduction

The idea of the in-development `rdfanalysis` package is to provide a coding environment that allows researchers to systematically document and analyze the degrees of freedom in their research designs. The notion "researcher degrees of freedom" has been introduced by [Simmons et al., (Psyc Science, 2011)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797611417632). In their own words (p. 1359): 

> The culprit is a construct we refer to as *researcher degrees of freedom*.
> In the course of collecting and analyzing data,
> researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data
> be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which
> conditions should be combined and which ones compared?
> Which control variables should be considered? 
> Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?

This vignette will use a case to guide you through the process of how to use the package for an analysis that make its inherent researcher degrees of freedom transparent.
The outcome of this activity will be similar to the multiverse analysis approach suggested by [Steeger et al. (Persp on Psych Sci 2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691616658637).

## The Case

As case I assess the impact of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita on life expectancy. This association has become known as the [Preston Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_curve) ([Preston, Pop Studies, 1975](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00324728.1975.10410201)). While the analysis it not meant to contribute to the question whether there is a causal link between these two constructs, I design the analysis such that identifying assumptions for such a causal interpretation of its findings are explicit.

## Step 1: Define your research design by a series of functions

Every research design can be implemented as a series of functions where each function reads the output of the previous function and produces output for the next function.
The first function reads or generates data, the last function generates results. In principle, the `rdfanalysis` package is agnostic about the data structure that constitutes a result. In most cases, the result will take the form of one or several confidence intervals.

To assess the impact of GDP per capita on life expectancy, our case design follows the following steps

- Read data
- Define variables
- Select variables for model
- Treat extreme observations
- Estimate model

Each step will be implemented via a function. To set up such a functional structure, you use the command `define_design()`. This function creates a series of function templates in a directory of your choice. Existing files are not over-written. You can choose whether you want your functions all in one R file or whether you want to go with separtate files. I am going with seperate files here.

``` {r define_design, eval = FALSE}
library(rdfanalysis)
library(ExPanDaR)

design <- define_design(steps = c("read_data", 
                                  "define_vars", 
                                  "select_vars", 
                                  "treat_extreme_obs", 
                                  "est_model"),
                        rel_dir = "case_study_code")
```

## Step 2: Implement design steps

When you take a look at the newly created directory, you will see a set of R files. Each file contains a template like this:

``` {r template}
read_data <- function(input = NULL, choice = NULL) {
  # This is a template for a design step
  # to be used by the rdfanalysis package
  # See https://joachim-gassen.github.io/rdfanalysis
  # for further information on how to use this template
  # and the package.

  # Feel free to delete any/all comments line but leave
  # the line containing ("Analysis code starts below") unchanged.

  # Provide your documentation in the two variables below.
  # They will be used by prepare_design_documentation()

  step_description <- c(
    "## [Step Title]",
    "### Content",
    "",
    "[Explain what the step does]"
  )
  choice_description <- c(
    "### Choice",
    "",
    "`[name of discrete choice]`: A character value containing one of the",
    "following values:",
    "",
    "- `[valid_value 1]`: [What this choice does]",
    "- `[valid_value n]`: [What that step does]",
    "",
    "`[name of continous choice]`: [Explain valid range for continous choice",
    "and what it does]"
  )

  # Specify your valid choices below. Format will be checked by test_design()
  # for consictency

  choice_type <- list(
    list(name = "[name of discrete choice]",
         type = "character",
         valid_values = c("[valid_value 1]", "[valid_value n]"),
         # weights are not required but they need to add ip to one if
         # they are provided. Adjust the example below
         weights = c(0.8, 0.2)),
    list(name = "[name of continous choice]",
         type = "double",
         valid_min = 0, valid_max = 0.1,
         # weights for continous choices are provided by a sample of choices.
         # Could be just one value. Adjust the example below
         weight_sample = c(0, rep(0.01, 4), rep(0.05, 4)))
  )

  # You should not need to change anything in this code section below

  if (is.null(choice)) return(list(
    step_description = step_description,
    choice_description = choice_description,
    choice_type = choice_type
  )) else check_choice(choice, choice_type)

  # Leave the following comment untouched. It is being used by
  # prepare_design_documentation to identify the part of the steps
  # that should be included in the documentation.

  # ___ Analysis code starts below ___

  # Here you need to add your code.

  # If this is the first step of your design, you can access input data via the
  # input parameter. If it is a subsequent step, you can access input data
  # via input$data and the protocol leading to this step by input$protocol.

  # Make sure that you address all choices identified above.

  # In the return block below, you need to replace the placeholder with the
  # variable that contains the data that you want to return as output
  # to the next step or as a result if this is the last step.

  return(list(
    data = "[variable containing your output data structure here]",
    protocol = list(choice)
  ))
}
```

The task is now to implement the code for each step. To do so, you should first set `step_description` and `choice_description`. Each variable takes a vector of strings that will be concatenated to RMarkdown code. Use these variables to explain what the steps does and which choices it contains. Each choice establishes a researcher degree of freedom.

As an example: When we import the raw data, we can decide whether we require each country-year observation to have non-missing data for all variables. To implement this discrete choice, you document it in `choice_description` and specify it in `choice_type`. The `weight` parameter can be used to provide the choice (or weighting of choices) that you *a priori* assume to be supported by theory. The final function `read_data()` is provided below. It simply reads a csv file containing data, limits the sample to the required variables and deletes cases with missing data if the choice `na.omit` is set to `"yes"`.

``` {r read_data}
read_data <- function(input = NULL, choice = NULL) {
  step_description <- c(
    "## Read data",
    "### Content",
    "",
    "Reads country year world bank data CSV file and generates raw samples"
  )
  choice_description <- c(
    "### Choice",
    "",
    "`na.omit`: A character value containing one of the",
    "following values:",
    "",
    "- `yes`: All observations with missing data are excluded",
    "- `no`: All observations with missing data are included",
  )

  # Specify your valid choices below. Format will be checked by test_design()
  # for consictency

  choice_type <- list(
    list(name = "na.omit",
         type = "character",
         valid_values = c("yes", "no"),
         weights = c(1, 0)),
  )
  if (is.null(choice)) return(list(
    step_description = step_description,
    choice_description = choice_description,
    choice_type = choice_type
  )) else check_choice(choice, choice_type)
  # ___ Analysis code starts below ___

  df <- read_csv(input) %>%
    select(country, year,
           lifeexpectancy, gdp_capita,
           resdevelop_gdp, unemployment) 
  
  if(choice == "yes") df <- df %>%
    na.omit()

  return(list(
    data = df,
    protocol = list(choice)
  ))
}
```

For the other steps you follow this approach. For our case study, I implement the following choices:

- `define_vars()`: `log_gdp_capita` determines whether the main variable of interest is used in logged specification or not.
- `select_vars()`: `idvs` identifies the independent variables that you want to include in the regression model
- `treat_extreme_obs()`: `outlier_tment_style` indicates whether you want to use truncating or winsorizing to limit the influence of extreme observations. `outlier_cutoff` holds the percentile cutoff. It can be within the range [0, 0.1] (0 to 10 %).
- `est_model()`: `feffects` reports which fixed effects are used (none, country, year or both) and `cluster` indicates how the standard errors should be clustered (not, by country, by year, or two-way by country and year).

All these choices are rather standard choices in research designs based on observational data. Taken together and assuming that you want to generate outlier cases for each percentile from 0 to 10, they generate $2 * 2 * 4 * 2 * 11 * 4 * 4 = 5632$ researcher degrees of freedom! 

Below you will find all four functions. Copy and paste them into the template files to generate your research design.

``` {r functions, eval = FALSE}
define_vars <- function(input = NULL, choice = NULL) {
  step_description <- c(
    "## Define the variables to be used in the analysis",

  choice_description <- c(

    "`log_gdp_capita`: A character value containing one of the",
    "following values:",
