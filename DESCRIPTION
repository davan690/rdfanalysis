Description: This experimental in development package provides a set of functions 
    that support researchers to develop code so that it systematically documents
    researcher degrees of freedom. The resulting code base is self-documenting, 
    supports unit testing and power simulations based on simulated data. The 
    documented researcher degrees of freedom can be exhausted to generate a 
    distribution of outcome estimates.
